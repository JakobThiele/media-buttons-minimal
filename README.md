# Media Buttons Minimal

The goal of this app is to use media button inputs of headsets (bluetooth and wired) without playing audio.

## Main Issue (so far):

On the Pixel 6, when using a wired headset with just one button, the google search bar will take audio focus with the second button press, routing all following media button events to the google search bar. I can't replicate it on my Surface Duo 2, and I don't have more phones to test.
